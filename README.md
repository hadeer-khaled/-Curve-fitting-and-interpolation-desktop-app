# Data-Curve-fitting
Using curve fitting for any data with customized options as the order of fitting, the number of chunks and extrapolation.
Also an error map is generated for the data where the user can pick which 2 variables to use and keep the third a constant value.
The fitting equation is displayed in case of 1 chunck, whereas in case of dividing the data into multiple chunks, the user can select which chunk's fitting equation to show 
and the chunk is labeled on the graph.
The error percentage betweem the fitted curve and the real data points is represented above the graph

This is how the desktop application looks

This is in case of 1 chunck curve fitting with a polynomial with order 7 and its error map

This is in case of dividing the data into 5 chunks

This is in case of 70% extrapolation
